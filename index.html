  <p"All our knowledge has its orgins in our perceptions." -Leonardo da Vinchi style</p>

  <p> Leonardo da Vinchi was most popularly known as a promient artist who lived in the time of the Renaissance. However, this was not his only expertise. Lenarado da Vinchi was a polymath, meaning that he studied numerous subjects, including:
      </p>
<ol>
  <il>Art,</il>
  <il>Nature,</il>
  <il>Physics,</il>
  <il>Architecture and</il>
  <il>Philosophy</il>
</ol>
<p>Among his various interests, he stuied philosophy. He believed that how one related to the world was through perception. Perception is the ability to take in infomation through the senses. However, perception is defined by a person's personal beliefs, thoughts and expirences. Perception will always be subjective and filtered though these constituents. Perspective is also affected by the senses in which we take in infomation. </p>

<h>Leonardo da Vinchi and the Five Senses</h>
<p>In order to expirence and percieve the world around, you rely on your five senses. Leonardo da Vinchi defined the five senses in which we can experience the world. He believed that the senses are what make life enjoyable. The senses include: </p>
<ul>
  <il>Sight,</il>
  <il>Hearing,</il>
  <il>Touch,</il>
  <il>Taste and</il>
  <il>Smell</il>
</ul>
<p>Though he believed that sight is the most important sense, it is clear that Leonardo da Vinchi immersed himself in each sense in order to gain knowledge and understanding about the world around. His view of the natural world was for it to be observed, learned from and enjoyed, which is what fueled him to learn and create. Our perception of the world is what guides us to make choices that can change the course of our lives. Through the filters of our personal beliefs, experiences, thoughts and senses, we gain and interpret understanding and knowledge. Perspective defines us and it is one of the most powerful tools in experiencing the world.</p>
